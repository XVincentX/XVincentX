#### Long version

My name is Vincenzo; I am a Software Developer living in Austin (Texas) focused on WebAPIs and User Interfaces. 

Over the last 8 years, I've been mostly working for SAAS companies providing tools for API Developers, contributing heavily on the engineering side as well as managing small teams.

Currently, I'm working at [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com), and most of the code I write is ~~TypeScript~~ ~~Python~~Â **Clojure**, but in general I am always eager to learn new programming languages. I have a decent proficiency in Haskell.

I hold a BA in Computer Engineering (not too sure how useful this information is), and I have been speaking to a number of events around the world (the complete list is on my [terrible website](https://vncz.codes/talks)

I have been awarded the titles [Auth0 Ambassador](https://auth0.com/blog/authors/vincenzo-chianese/), [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-vincenzo-chianese) in Web Technologies as well as [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5003614?fullName=Vincenzo%20Chianese) in Developer Technologies.

I've also got a very long ongoing collaboration with the [API Days Team](https://apidays.co/meet-the-team). I've started by speaking at their conferences, I ended up being in the committee that reviews the CFP and organising an entire event in [Barcelona in September 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NLXKhpv8I8&t=380s).

My mid-long term interests include collaborative editing, publishing, managing teams.
