#### Long version

My name is Vincenzo; I am a Software Developer living in Austin (Texas) focused on WebAPIs and User Interfaces. 

Over the last 6 years, I've been mostly working for SAAS companies providing tools for API Developers, contributing heavily on the engineering side as well as managing small teams.

Currently, I'm working at [SentinelOne](https://sentinelone.com), and most of the code I write is ~~TypeScript~~ ~~Python~~Â ~~Clojure~~, but in general I am always eager to learn new programming languages. I have a decent proficiency in Clojure and Haskell.

I hold a BA in Computer Engineering (not too sure how useful this information is), and I have been speaking to a number of events around the world (the complete list is at https://vncz.codes/talks)

I have been awarded the titles Auth0 Ambassador, Google Developer Expert in Web Technologies as well as Microsoft MVP in Developer Technologies.

I've also got a very long ongoing collaboration with the API Days Team (https://apidays.co/meet-the-team). I've started by speaking at their conferences, I ended up being in the committee that reviews the CFP and organising an entire event in Barcelona in September 2019.

My mid-long term interests include collaborative editing, publishing, managing teams.
